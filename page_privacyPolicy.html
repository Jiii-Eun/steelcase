                      <p>If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our products or services, you can opt-out by  logging into the Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an e-mail stating your request using the “Contact Us” form. If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you may click on the opt-out option included in the email and thus send us a return e-mail asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions.

We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
